## My process

Started with skeleton/structure of the webpage then moved to the styling using CSS and finally the javascript for the "click" and other function property and also a javascript library of JQuery.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript Functions
- JQuery

### What I learned

I learned and got a better understanding of to add functionality and behaviour to a website using JQuery.

### Continued development

I would like to develop more in the aspect of functions in JQuery
